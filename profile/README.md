# MagriLab
Research group in data-driven fluid mechanics led by [Luca Magri](https://magrilab.ae.ic.ac.uk/). 

### **Published Research**
- [x] [ESN-MFE](https://github.com/MagriLab/ESN-MFE) - Control and prediction of turbulent shear flow (Moehlis-Faisst-Eckhardt) with Echo State Networks.
<br> *Prediction and control of turbulent shear flow with Echo State Networks. A. Racca and L. Magri, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (2022); Physical Review Fluids (2022).*



### **Install and Run**
- [x] [KolSol](https://github.com/MagriLab/KolSol) - pseudospectral Kolmogorov flow solver, contains both NumPy and PyTorch implementations to allow for autograd-compatible workflows.
